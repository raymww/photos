                <p>
                    The D750 is my main, all-purpose camera. It's a full frame 24mp dslr camera 
                    and is able to get the best out of my lenses. I chose the D750 for being full frame, having amazing ergonomics,
                    and coming in at a great used price point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use the D750 for just about everything that doesn't require extremely fast action. For portraits, landscapes, events,
                    and just day to day shooting, you'll see me with the D750 in my hand.

                <p>
                    The D7500 is a camera that I use specifically for fast action purposes such as sports and wildlife, or any
                    scenario that I need the extra reach that it's apsc-format sensor gives me. It shoots 8 frames per second and balances
                    really well with the heavier and longer lenses that I have, letting me zero in and capture everything fast moving.

                <p>
                    This is my workhorse lens that I pair with the D7500 for anything action and sports related. It's focus is quick and 
                    its fast f2.8 aperture lets me get the light to freeze my subjects in place. At first, I had a tough time focusing 
                    due to some backfocusing but after dialing the focus in with an adapter from Tamron, it has been super sharp and 
                    accurate.

                <p>
                    This 85mm f1.8 prime lens from Tamron is my bokeh machine. At 85mm, I can use it on my D750 as a standard portrait lens or 
                    throw it on the D7500 to get a effective 135mm focal length for a more compressed look. It has some the fastest
                    focusing I've ever seen and it is super sharp. My only complaint is that the stabilization has a slight whining noise that 
                    can get annoying!

                <p>
                    As you might have seen, I really love Tamron's lenses. They have great image quality and focusing speed
                    all while coming in at a much cheaper price point than Nikon's native lenses. This 35mm prime is my go-to
                    walk around lens for landscapes as well as for wider, more environmental portraits. It's small and light 
                    and given how much I love the 35mm focal length, this is the most common lens on my camera!

                <p>
                    The Tamron 100-400 is my ultra-zoom lens that gives me insane reach for the size and weight of the lens. 
                    With the D750, it's a great landscape lens for picking out the smaller details compared to my primes. 
                    With the D7500, the lens becomes a 150-600 for basically half the size and is perfect for wildlife.

                <p>
                    The Minolta X-370 is my film camera. I pair it with Minolta's 50mm f1.7 and it's been all that I need for film.
                    The X-370 has a great meter and a super satisfying film crank and shutter sound. The 50mm 1.7 is a great lens that
                    produces images with character. I've been experimenting with film stocks and my favorites are definitely Portra and 
                    Cinestill.
